## Do not use, as the encryption workflow is constantly changing, so files encrypted with one version might not be decryptable with new versions. (Until the final workflow has been decided)
### Resonably secure encryption

Changelog 7/19/23 03~ :
* General code quality improvements (Ongoing)
* Switched from own hex encoding \ decoding to node:buffer
* Completely switched away from CryptoJS in favour of the native node:crypto
* Wrote JSDocs for everything in 🐟/cryptography.js, 🐟/compression.js, index.js, and 🦈.js
* Deleted 🐟/generic.js and moved functions to 🦈.js
* Improved the encryptObject function by switching to aes-256-cbc (same goes for the decryptObject function)
* Wrote comments for everything in 🐟/cryptography.js, 🐟/compression.js, index.js, and 🦈.js
* switched to readlineSync for gathering user input (2fa, Y/N)
* Created 🐟/synchronousOsInfo.js (Blatantly stolen and picked apart from: sebhildebrandt/systeminformation)
* Removed unused dependencies (hwid, systeminformation, yesno, crypto-js)

Changelog 7/17/23 13~ :
* TOTP (Time-based one time password) (example: Google Authentacater)
* Completely removed all MD5 ussage to be safe against collision attacks
* Auto building binaries via Github Actions
* compiling macOS x64 binaries (arm is a bit weird right now but im working on it)

Changelog 7/17/23 12~ :
* Added --copy & --string that allows copying results to clipboard, and encrypting and decrypting of strings instead of files.
* Added checkid file that allows getting info about a ID file given the key
* Prettified* console output

Upcomming:
* Directory encryption \ decryption (zip, encrypt zip w extra metadata)
* Save and load password from env, then use with --saved / -sv
* Write docs
